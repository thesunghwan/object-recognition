function image_feats = get_spatial_pyramid(image_paths)
% image_paths is an N x 1 cell array of strings where each string is an
% image path on the file system.

% This function assumes that 'vocab.mat' exists and contains an N x 128
% matrix 'vocab' where each row is a kmeans centroid or visual word. This
% matrix is saved to disk rather than passed in a parameter to avoid
% recomputing the vocabulary every run.

% image_feats is an N x d matrix, where d is the dimensionality of the
% feature representation. In this case, d will depend on the structure of
% the spatial pyramid you construct. 

load('vocab.mat')
vocab_size = size(vocab, 2);
